# GitHub Candidate Search

## Description

This project was an exercise in using React and TypeScript to fetch user data from GitHub's API and optionally save it to local storage, from which it can be displayed on a list. This simple application fetches a random GitHub user and provides the option to skip the user or save them. Users can also be deleted from the list of saved candidates.

## Usage

The application is [deployed live here](https://taupe-tapioca-bac071.netlify.app/).

Simply press the red X to skip a candidate, or the green checkmark to save them. Click "Potential Candidates" at the top to see your saved candidates, and click the red "Reject" button to remove them from the list.
